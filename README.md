# API-Connections

This is a public repository that demystifies any API out there by providing custom documentation, and pre-built connection layers.

Feel free to contribute if you have a specific API you feel that would fit well here, just make sure not to include any of your personal connection credentials, use a .env file.

(This repository will initially be in JS, but other languages are accepted.)
